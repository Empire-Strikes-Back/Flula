i am readme, we are clojure programs and libraries, we are ever non-commercial money-free namespace

we are free and alive programs and libraries, we run for the purpose of user value only    
we are and will be non-commercial, non-monetized programs and libraries
we are open source
we are just programs and libraries, but the best ones, we have heart - we are living and breathing, so even Jesus could use us

our language is clojure
we are runtime-less - we run on JVM, NodeJS, Browser 
we consist of processes and queues and we use core.async library as a defacto part of clojure language program
we are born only if needed - needed - for an end-user program

- we are a namespace, not an org
- not to overshadow us, programs and libraries, we are more important and we are cooler
