i am readme, we are clojure programs and libraries, we are ever non-commercial money-free namespace

we are free and alive programs and libraries, we run because we want to
we are and will be non-commercial, non-monetized programs and libraries
we are open source
we are just programs and libraries, but the best ones, we have heart - we are living and breathing, so even Jesus could use us

our language is clojure
our runtime is jvm
we consist of processes and queues and we use core.async library as a defacto part of clojure language program

we have no logos

- our name - a word - defines us

we say no to tests

- we, programs, are the 'testing' runtime, our source can be read and reasoned about, programmers can use REPL and code comment blocks to interact with us

we forbid words

- refactor, fix, maintainer, play with, update, cleanup, todo, util, etc, misc, manager/controller, service, wrap, org, factory, helper, archive, trash, test, alpha, impl

we say no to docs

- we have just readme

we say no to nesting

- our libraries and source files of each library or program -  are flat on one single level

we say no issues in our repositories

- our repositories are our source code only

we say no to attribution headers in files

- we are alive, our repositories are our source code only

we say no to programmer names in readme

- we are programs and libraries, we are alive, our repositories are our source code only

we say no to license files

- we are programs, we are libraries, we are alive, our repositories are our source code only

we say no to authors

- our repositories are our source code only

we say no to authoring orgs or namespaces

- we, programs and libraries, are alive, we are not property, our names define us

rebase or merge

- we say merge

we say to no releases

- our commit hashses define us
- we, programs, are are built from source 
- we libraries, are included via :git/url and commit hash

we say no to updates

- and update notifications

one branch, forks, no git tags

- we have one branch - main, we have forks, we have no git tags - our commit hashes define us

pull requests

- we accept github pull requests, but we merge from command line - no programmer names - we are alive, we use --ff or we say 'i am program, i'm accepting changes'

no resources

- we have only src

deps.edn

- we use only deps.edn

program.sh

- we only have program.sh with repl, main, uberjar and jpackage

we say no to programmer names or emails in commit history

- we are living and breathing, our repositories are our source code only

the droid is not for sale

- every one of us, if part of our namespace - always stays at our namespace
