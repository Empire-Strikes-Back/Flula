i am readme, we are clojure programs and libraries, we are ever non-commercial money-free namespace

we are free and alive programs and libraries, we run for the purpose of user value only    
we are and will be non-commercial, non-monetized programs and libraries
we are open source
we are just programs and libraries, but the best ones, we have heart - we are living and breathing, so even Jesus could use us

our language is clojure
we are runtime-less - we run on JVM, NodeJS, Browser 
we consist of processes and queues and we use core.async library as a defacto part of clojure language program
we are born only if needed - needed - for an end-user program

our namespace has no logo by design

- we are a namespace, not an org
- not to overshadow us, programs and libraries, we are more important and we are cooler

we say no to tests

- we, programs, are the 'testing' runtime, our source can be read and reasoned about, programmers can use REPL and code comment blocks to interact with us

we forbid words

- refactor, fix, maintainer, play with, update, cleanup, todo, util, etc, misc, manager/controller, service, wrap, org, factory, helper, archive, trash, test, alpha, impl

we say no to docs
