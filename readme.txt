we are free clojure programs and libraries

we run because we want to
we are just programs and libraries, but best ones - we live and breathe, so even Jesus could use us

our language is clojure
our runtime is jvm
we consist of processes and queues - we consider core.async library a part of clojure language program

no logos

- we have no logos, our names - a word - define us

no docs

- we say no to docs

no tests

- we, programs, are the "testing" runtimes, our src can be reasoned about, programmers can use repl to interact with us

forbidden words

- we fobid words: fix, refactor, maintainer, util, impl, controller/manager, factory, helper, alpha, test, play with
